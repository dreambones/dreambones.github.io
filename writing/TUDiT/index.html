<h1 id="the-universe-dreams-in-technicolor">The Universe Dreams in Technicolor</h1>
<p><strong>The Universe Dreams in Technicolor (TUDiT)</strong> is a sci-fi approach to high fantasy, combining the fantastical and mundane in a world where the dead do the tango and gods deliver mail. The typical pitfalls of fantasy are set aside in favor of a more open-minded and diverse setting: no matter who or what you are, you still have to pay taxes.</p>
<p>TUDiT has been a multi-year world-building project that may one day become an indie TTRPG system, but for now, I'm still working on the setting's details!</p>

	<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
	<p>Magic is simply a fact of the world. It exists in the air, the land, and the water. Once called "wild forces," it's now taught in schools and used in homes, a facet of identity and biology, much like other species that evolved to control it. The intelligent peoples of the world all evolved to create and store magic in their bodies, but when their bodies die, their magic comes to life as <strong>spirits</strong>. Most spirits stay asleep in their graves, but every so often, a spirit will come awake and reintegrate within society, sometimes taking on new names, identities, and fancy forms!</p>
	<p>Far, far less frequently, seemingly at random, spirits will bind to their dead bodies, magic seeping into every pore and joint, then awaken as <strong>gods</strong>: immortal beings capable of changing their forms at will, living supercomputers claiming jurisdiction over different aspects of life and magic then accruing power through those that pray to them. But whether they're truly gods or just resemble them, no one can agree--and not every god goes the route of religion. Some gods have found that running businesses is far more fulfilling or profitable, some eschew godhood altogether and live as hermits, using their powers in private.</p>
	<p>So, what's life like when the dead and the debatably divine walk among you?</p>
