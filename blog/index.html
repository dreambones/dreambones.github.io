			<h3>Holy carp! The passage of time!</h3>

		<p>Goodness, it's been nearly a whole year since I properly updated the website! Hello!<br>I finally decided to move from neocities to GitHub Pages, and I'm using 11ty! Wow! It's way less of a hassle to update the navigation and footer now. I'll definitely be spending a good bit of time learning the ins and outs of templating languages, but hopefully this transition will lead to more frequent updates to the website! I changed a lot of content and will be trying to make the website look nicer in my free time. Stay tuned!</p>

			<h3>A Bit of Shoe Shine</h3>

		<p>It's another update of backend and frontend improvements! This time there's more noticeable changes to the <a href="/other">Other page</a> with new expanding card-based recommendations that are a lot easier on eyes and page space, along with changes to how blockquotes look, more shadows across the site for depth, along with some layout and wording changes to the <a href="/art/commissions">Commissions page</a> (still haven't fixed the dinked banner/sign though, sorry!). Plus a few extra, more minor things here and there. Hope y'all enjoy!</p>

			<h3>New stuff? New stuff!</h3>

		<p>Guess who updated the website again? This guy! There's actual <strong>visual differences</strong> now like the site using two different fun fonts, shadows on first-level headings, a bunch of new and old art added to <a href="/art">the art page</a>, and <a href="/other/tips-and-tricks">a new page for art and writing tips</a>! I'm still in the middle of adding more content to that page, but it'll be a gradual process (partially because I'll have to spend ages finding where I put all of my art and writing tips...)<br>Still, hope ya'll like the new update as much as I do! :]</p>

		<p>Hello!! Long time no update, but I did a few edits to the website! It's mostly backend stuff, but there's some visual differences! Related: semantic HTML is awesome, and <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/">this article that uses every HTML element</a> was a serious help with cleaning up my HTML and making it easier to navigate and edit!</p>
